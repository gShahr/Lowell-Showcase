# Lowell-Showcase

* Practicing and showcasing what I can do purely in an academic computer science setting. (Mainly in java and C++)

* Main focus: Data Structures, Algorithms and practicing C++, C, Java.

Folders: 

  - Amherst_187: consists of projects that were assigned to that class (In java and covers data structures)
  
    - Recently added Assignment 3, which is the set project 
    
      - Implementing a set with a linked list
      
    - Added 2 more projects (currently working on Towers of Hanoi, which is Assignment 6).
    
    - Ran into an error in assingment 6 where the for each loop isn't working as expected for the given test case (regular for loop works) 
    
      - This error is interesting because the object array that the for each loop is supposed to be iterating through has a length of 1, which means that it should hypothetically run through the loop because it has one element in it. This semantic error does not make sense to me
    
    - Currently working on project 7, which is queue implementation along with level order traversal of a tree and using a queue for merge sort
    
    - Almost finished with project 7 (merge sort, level order traversal, and queues) and going to upload soon - Finished it 
    
    - Currently working on project 9 - just finished 8 (linked lists implemented recursively) - test cases were created by me
    
    - Project 9 consists of implementing binary search tree methods 
      
  
  - HackerRank: consists of various exercises on the HackerRank website (Mostly data structures and algorithms)
  
  - CodeForces & LeetCode: solved various problems there
  
    - Occasionally particpating in contests as well along with other things
    
    - Currently working on mastering dats structures in java and hoping to use that knoweledge for c++
    
    - I'm going to stop uploading code for these problems because there are too many and the data is all stored on my account if I need to reference them
    
SideNote: 
   
    
    - A lot of people have doubt in me that I do not have the knowledge needed to be successful in computer science
    
    - I am hoping to accomplish my goals by the start of September
