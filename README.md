# Lowell-Showcase

* Practicing and showcasing what I can do purely in an academic computer science setting. (Mainly in java and C++)

* Main focus: Data Structures, Algorithms and practicing C++, C, Java.

Folders: 

  - Amherst_187: consists of projects that were assigned to that class (In java and covers data structures)
  
    - Recently added Assignment 3, which is the set project 
    
      - Implementing a set with a linked list
      
    - Added 2 more projects (currently working on Towers of Hanoi, which is Assignment 6).
    
    - Ran into an error in assingment 6 where the for each loop isn't working as expected for the given test case (regular for loop works)
    
    - Currently working on project 7, which is queue implementation along with level order traversal of a tree and using a queue for merge sort
    
    - Almost finished with project 7 and going to upload soon
      
  
  - HackerRank: consists of various exercises on the HackerRank website (Mostly data structures and algorithms)
  
  - CodeForces & LeetCode: solved various problems there
  
    - Occasionally particpating in contests as well along with other things
    
    - Currently working on mastering dats structures in java and hoping to use that knoweledge for c++
    
    SideNote: 
    
    - A lot of people have doubt in me that I do not have the knowledge needed to be successful in computer science
